### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite because it turned a health formula into code. It applied to the real world. And I got comfortable writing functions in this lab and more comfortable formating. 

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 2 was a favorite because it was a real challenge for me. It was difficult, but I still learned a lot. I learned how to use truncation in coding and how to convert decimal feet into feet and inches. 

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was a favorite because it created a fun game. And it was also simple. This lab had my debugging a few times which helped with my debugging skills.
