### CPSC 120

* Lab 3

    Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite because it turned a real life health formula into code. It applied to the real world. I didn't feel like something that was a waste of time. Also in this lab, I got real comfortable writing functions in and more comfortable formating.

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 2 was a favorite because it was a real challenge for me. It was difficult, but I still learned a lot. I learned how to use truncation in coding and how to convert decimal feet into feet and inches. This was also the lab that I felt that I fully understood what formatting was really about.

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 2 was a favorite because it created a fun game that was also simple. I played it a few times with my lab partner of that week. This lab had my debugging a few times which helped with my debugging skills.
